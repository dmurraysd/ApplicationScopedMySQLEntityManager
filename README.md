# ApplicationScopedMySQLEntityManager

Description:
Basic java login GUI application demonstrating the connection between a java program and a mySQL database using persistence concepts. 
An application scoped entity manager is used to control the transactions between the program and the mySQL server.

Movitation:
The goal of publishing the application is to display my coding style for potential employers and to keep me focused on software development.

Installation:
The application isn't a working example for download, as the mySQL server has to be setup & the database created. I will add the mySQL script
that I used to create the database. On a later branch or another repository, I will add an embedded database to the application for executing. 
The main problem if the database is recreated is the username & password of the mySQL server on my computer. This can easily be changed to
a local mySQL server login details in the persistence.xml root & password section in the project files.

Concepts researched & implemented:
Persistence contexts, database entities, entity managers, transactions, mySQL database, GUI, enums, key event dispatchers.
Java SE, mySQL server 5.7, netbeans IDE 8.1
